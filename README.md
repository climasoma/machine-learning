# Machine learning to predict hydraulic conductivity for the OTIM-DB

This repository is part of the [EJP SOIL CLIMASOMA project](https://ejpsoil.eu/soil-research/climasoma/).

Based on the [OTIM-DB](https://github.com/climasoma/otim-db), a machine learning approach using **light gradient boosting** (LightGBM package) was tried.
